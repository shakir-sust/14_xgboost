# Overview of Regularized Regression Models

## Ridge Regression (L2 Penalty)

-   **Goal:** Handle multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients.\
-   **Mechanism:** Adds a penalty equal to the **sum of squared coefficients** (L2) to the loss function.\
-   **Effect:** Keeps all variables but shrinks their influence.\
-   **Use when:** You want to retain all features and reduce noise from collinearity.

![Ridge Coefficients](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/06-regularized-regression_files/figure-html/ridge-coef-example-1.png)

## Lasso Regression (L1 Penalty)

-   **Goal:** Reduce model complexity and perform variable selection.\
-   **Mechanism:** Adds a penalty equal to the **sum of absolute coefficients** (L1).\
-   **Effect:** Pushes some coefficients **exactly to zero** (automatic feature selection).\
-   **Use when:** You expect only a few variables to be important.

![Lasso Coefficients](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/06-regularized-regression_files/figure-html/lasso-coef-example-1.png)

## Elastic Net (L1 + L2 Penalty)

-   **Goal:** Combine ridge’s stability with lasso’s variable selection.\
-   **Mechanism:** Mixes L1 and L2 penalties to balance between shrinkage and selection.\
-   **Effect:** Selects features while keeping model robust with correlated predictors.\
-   **Use when:** Predictors are correlated and variable selection is needed.

# Tree-Based Methods

## Conditional Inference Tree (CIT)

-   **Goal:** Build interpretable trees using statistical tests.\
-   **Mechanism:** Iteratively selects variables with the **lowest p-value** and splits based on significance.\
-   **Effect:** Produces a decision tree that models nonlinear effects and includes feature selection.\
-   **Use when:** You want interpretability and built-in variable selection.

## Random Forest (RF)

-   **Goal:** Improve predictive performance by combining many trees.\
-   **Mechanism:** Trains trees on **bootstrapped data** with **random subsets of variables** at each split.\
-   **Effect:** Averages predictions from many trees to reduce variance and improve generalization.\
-   **Use when:** You need high accuracy, handle multicollinearity, and don’t mind a less interpretable model.

# Introduction to XGBoost

XGBoost (**Extreme Gradient Boosting**) is a powerful and scalable machine learning algorithm based on **gradient boosting**. It is particularly effective for **tabular or structured data** and is widely used in competitive data science and real-world applications due to its accuracy and speed.

Unlike Random Forest, which builds decision trees independently, XGBoost builds **trees sequentially**, where each new tree aims to **correct the prediction errors** made by the previous trees. It does this by **minimizing a specified loss function** using **gradient descent** techniques.

XGBoost also supports:

-   **Parallel tree construction**
-   **Regularization** (to prevent overfitting)
-   **Handling of missing values**
-   **Custom loss functions**
-   **Efficient memory usage and computation**

Due to these capabilities, XGBoost has become one of the most popular and high-performing machine learning libraries for problems involving **regression, classification, and ranking**.

## Key Differences Between Tree Models

![Key Differences](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/format:webp/1*XUwLtkWEPnLRXJjr5ht9Lg.png)

## How XGBoost Works

1.  Initialize with a base prediction (e.g., mean in regression).
2.  Compute residuals between prediction and actual values.
3.  Train a tree to predict these residuals (gradients).
4.  Update the model by adding the new tree’s predictions.
5.  Repeat steps 2–4 for a set number of iterations or until convergence.

# What is Ensemble Learning?

Ensemble learning combines multiple models (**weak learners**) to build a stronger overall model. It's based on the idea that a group of diverse models performs better than any individual model.

![Ensemble Concept](https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/creative-assets/s-migr/ul/g/b5/87/ensemble-learning-stacking.png)

## Types of Ensemble Learning

-   **Bagging**:
    -   Trains models independently using random subsets of data.
    -   Combines their predictions via averaging or voting.
    -   Example: Random Forest.
-   **Boosting**:
    -   Trains models sequentially.
    -   Each new model improves on the previous by reducing errors.
    -   Example: XGBoost, AdaBoost.

# Gradient Descent and Boosting

Gradient descent is an optimization technique used to minimize a loss (or cost) function by iteratively updating model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent (i.e., the negative gradient). Think of it like a skier choosing the steepest path downhill to reach the bottom as quickly as possible.

## Three Steps to Gradient Boosting

1.  **Loss Function Optimized**\
    A loss function is used to measure the error between the model’s predictions and the true values. Gradient descent is applied to minimize this loss by adjusting model parameters.

2.  **Weak Learner (Decision Tree)**\
    A weak learner, usually a shallow decision tree, is trained to predict the residual errors of the previous model. It performs just slightly better than random guessing.

3.  **Trees Added Sequentially**\
    New trees are added one after another, with each tree correcting the mistakes of the combined previous trees. This process continues until a target accuracy or number of trees is reached.

In **gradient boosting**, this idea is applied by sequentially fitting new decision trees to the residuals (errors) made by previous trees—gradually improving predictions step by step.

-   A **learning rate** determines how much each new tree corrects the errors.
    -   **Too small**: Learning is slow but stable.
    -   **Too large**: May overshoot or miss the minimum altogether.

Boosting can work with many loss functions (e.g., MSE, MAE, log loss), as long as they are differentiable.

# 🔧 Key XGBoost Hyperparameters

Tree level

## 🔢 Number of Predictors Sampled (`mtry`)

The `mtry` parameter defines how many predictors are randomly chosen at each split. This adds diversity among trees. Typical values range from 1 up to the total number of features. In XGBoost, this is sometimes referred to as `colsample_bytree`.

## ✂️ Loss Reduction

The `loss_reduction` parameter (also called `gamma`) defines the minimum gain required to make a split. If the reduction in loss from a split is less than this value, the split won't happen. This acts as a pruning mechanism to simplify trees and avoid overfitting. Common values range from 0 (no pruning) to 10+ in more conservative models.

## 📦 Minimum Observations in Terminal Nodes

The `min_n` parameter (also known as `min_child_weight`) sets the minimum number of observations required in a terminal node (leaf). It helps control the complexity of the tree. Higher values (e.g., 10 or more) prevent overfitting by stopping splits that rely on very few data points. Lower values (e.g., 1–5) allow for fine-grained patterns to be captured, which might be useful in cases of imbalanced datasets.

![Terminal Node Size](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*pt7Ei6v6fwQsFUvJY_akcg.png)

## 🌳 Tree Depth

The `tree_depth` parameter defines how deep each individual tree can grow. Deeper trees can capture complex patterns and feature interactions, but they also increase the chance of overfitting. Shallower trees are faster and more general. Typical depths range from 3 to 8, although a depth of 1 (decision stumps) is used in some high-noise or large-scale settings.

![Tree Depth Effect](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-12-at-07.03.52-1024x695.png){alt="Tree Depth Effect"}\
![Early Stopping Trees](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/07-decision-trees_files/figure-html/dt-early-stopping-1.png){alt="Early Stopping Trees"}

Forest Level

## 🌲 Number of Trees

The `trees` hyperparameter refers to the number of boosting rounds, or how many trees are added one after another. More trees generally mean better performance as errors are corrected at each stage. However, too many trees—especially combined with a high learning rate—can cause overfitting. A good practice is to use cross-validation to find the optimal number of trees. Typical values range from 100 to over 1000.

![Tuning Trees](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/09-random-forest_files/figure-html/tuning-trees-1.png)

## ⚡ Learning Rate

The `learn_rate` (also called `eta`) controls how much influence each tree has on the final model. It's essentially the step size used in gradient descent. Smaller values (like 0.01) make the model learn slowly and carefully, requiring more trees. Larger values (like 0.3) speed up learning but may increase the risk of overfitting. Common ranges are from 0.01 to 0.3. Lower values typically result in better generalization.

![Gradient Descent Steps](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/10-gradient-boosting_files/figure-html/gradient-descent-fig-1.png) ![](https://kevinvecmanis.io/assets/xgb_tuning/learning.png)

## 🧪 Sample Size

The `sample_size` parameter determines the proportion of the training data used to fit each tree (row subsampling). A value of 1 means all rows are used; values like 0.5–0.8 are commonly used to add randomness and reduce overfitting.

# 🌲 XGBoost vs. Random Forest

Both algorithms are based on decision trees, but they differ in how the trees are built and combined.

-   **XGBoost** uses a boosting approach where trees are built sequentially. Each new tree corrects errors made by previous ones. It includes regularization (L1 and L2), offers pruning, supports early stopping, and is optimized for speed through parallel processing. It often provides higher accuracy, especially on structured/tabular data.
-   **Random Forest**, in contrast, builds trees in parallel using bootstrap samples and averages their predictions. It’s more robust, less prone to overfitting by default, and easier to tune, making it a good starting point for many tasks. However, it lacks the fine control and flexibility offered by boosting methods like XGBoost.

# ✅ Pros of XGBoost

-   High accuracy due to sequential boosting
-   Built-in L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
-   Very fast and scalable thanks to parallel computing
-   Handles missing values internally without imputation
-   Provides feature importance scores
-   Supports both regression and classification tasks
-   Allows custom loss/objective functions
-   Offers pruning and early stopping to improve generalization

# ⚠️ Cons of XGBoost

-   More complex to tune compared to simpler models
-   Higher risk of overfitting if not carefully tuned
-   Less interpretable than a single decision tree or linear model
-   Takes longer to train with large datasets
-   Requires special handling for time-series tasks
-   Only designed for supervised learning problems

# ML Workflow with XGBoost

## Step 1: Load Libraries

We begin by loading the required libraries:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#install.packages("xgboost") #new pacakage
library(tidymodels)   # Core framework for modeling (includes recipes, workflows, parsnip, etc.)
library(finetune)     # Additional tuning strategies (e.g., racing, ANOVA-based tuning)
library(vip)          # For plotting variable importance from fitted models
library(xgboost)      # XGBoost implementation in R
library(ranger)       # Fast implementation of Random Forests
library(tidyverse)    # Data wrangling and visualization
library(doParallel)   # For parallel computing (useful during resampling/tuning)
#library(caret)       # Other great library for Machine Learning 
```

# Load the data set

-   Setting a seed ensures reproducibility.
-   Splitting data helps validate generalizability by preventing the model from seeing the test data during training.

```{r weather}

weather <- read_csv("../data/weather_monthsum.csv")

weather

```

-   We begin by splitting the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.
-   We use **stratified sampling** to ensure that the distribution of the target variable is maintained in both sets.
-   A random **seed** is set to ensure reproducibility of the split.
-   This step ensures that the model is validated on unseen data, helping assess its **generalizability**.

> ⚠️ Note: Since tree-based models (like XGBoost and Random Forest) are not affected by the scale of the features, **normalization or standardization is not necessary**

# ML workflow

## 1. Pre-processing [initial split]

```{r weather_split}

set.seed(931735) # Setting seed to get reproducible results 

weather_split <- initial_split(
  weather, 
  prop = .7, # proption of split same as previous codes
  strata = strength_gtex  # Stratify by target variable
  )

weather_split

```

### a. Data split [for training set and testing set]

For data split, let's use **70% training / 30% testing**.

```{r weather_train}

weather_train <- training(weather_split)  # 70% of data

weather_train #This is your traing data frame

```

```{r weather_test}

weather_test <- testing(weather_split)    # 30% of data

weather_test

```

### b. Distribution of target variable [Comparing distribution of predicted/target variable in training and test sets]

```{r distribution}

ggplot() +
  geom_density(data = weather_train, 
               aes(x = strength_gtex),
               color = "red") +
  geom_density(data = weather_test, 
               aes(x = strength_gtex),
               color = "blue") 
  
```

### c. Data processing with recipe

Before training, we need to perform some processing steps, like

-   normalizing
-   **removing unimportant variables**
-   dropping NAs
-   performing PCA on the go
-   removing columns with single value
-   others?

For that, we'll create a **recipe** of these processing steps.

This recipe will then be applied now to the **train data**, and easily applied to the **test data** when we bring it back at the end.

Creating a recipe is an easy way to port your processing steps for other data sets without needing to repeat code, and also only considering the data it is being applied to.

You can find all available recipe step options here: https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/index.html

Different model types require different processing steps.\
Let's check what steps are required for an elastic net model (linear_reg). We can search for that in this link: https://www.tmwr.org/pre-proc-table #Don't need for numeric data

> Differently from elastic net, variables do not need to be normalized in XgBoost, so we'll skip this step.

```{r weather_recipe}

# Create recipe for data preprocessing

weather_recipe <- recipe(strength_gtex ~ ., 
                         data = weather_train
                         ) %>% # Remove identifier columns and months not in growing season
  step_rm(
    year,       # Remove year identifier
    site,       # Remove site identifier
    matches("Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|Nov|Dec")  # Remove non-growing season months
  )

weather_recipe

```

```{r weather_prep}

# Prep the recipe to estimate any required statistics

weather_prep <- weather_recipe %>% 
  prep()

# Examine preprocessing steps

weather_prep

```

## 2. Training

### a. Model specification [and hyperparameter fine tuning]

First, let's specify:\
- the **type of model** we want to train\
- which **engine** we want to use\
- which **mode** we want to use

> Elastic nets can only be run for a numerical response variable. XgBoost can be run with either numerical (regression) or categorical (classification) explanatory variable. Therefore, we have the need to specify the mode here.

XgBoost **hyperparameters**:

-   **`trees`**: The number of boosting rounds (i.e., how many trees will be added sequentially).\
-   **`tree_depth`**: Controls how deep each individual tree can grow. Deeper trees can capture more complex interactions but also increase the risk of overfitting.\
-   **`min_n`**: Minimum number of observations required in a node for it to be split. Acts as a regularization tool to prevent overly specific splits.\
-   **`learn_rate`**: Also known as `eta`, it controls how much each additional tree contributes to the overall model. Smaller values make the model more stable but require more trees.

```{r xgb_spec}

xgb_spec <- boost_tree(
  trees = tune(),
  tree_depth = tune(),  # Maximum depth of each tree
  min_n = tune(),  # Minimum samples required to split a node
  learn_rate = tune()
  ) %>% #Specifying XgBoost as our model type, asking to tune the hyperparameters
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% #specify engine 
  set_mode("regression")  # Set to mode #If the predicted (y) variable is numerical, we mention "regression" inside "set_mode()", if the predicted (y) variable is categorical, we mention "classification" inside "set_mode()"
 
xgb_spec

```

### b. V-fold Cross-validation setup

We use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance during tuning:

```{r}

set.seed(235) #34549

resampling_foldcv <- vfold_cv(weather_train, # Create 5-fold cross-validation resampling object from training data
                              v = 10)

resampling_foldcv
resampling_foldcv$splits[[1]]

```

### c. Hyperparameter grid search with Latin Hypercube Sampling

We use Latin hypercube sampling to generate a diverse grid of hyperparameter combinations:

```{r }

xgb_grid <- grid_latin_hypercube(
  trees(),
  tree_depth(),
  min_n(),
  learn_rate(),
 
  size = 100 # specifying the number of hyperparameter combinations to be used in the grid search  #100 combinations of all 4 hyperparameters to fine tune these hyperparameters; using more may yield better results
  
)

xgb_grid

```



```{r}

ggplot(data = xgb_grid,
       aes(x = tree_depth, 
           y = min_n)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(learn_rate), #coloring the bubbles based on learn_rate
                 size = trees), #size of the bubbles are based on the tress
             alpha = .5,
             show.legend = FALSE)

```



## 3. Model Tuning

```{r xgb_grid_result}

#install.packages("doParallel")
#install.packages("parallel")

#library(doParallel)
#library(parallel)

set.seed(76544)

#parallel processing
registerDoParallel(cores = parallel::detectCores()-1) # starts parallel processing

xgb_res <- tune_race_anova(
                      object = xgb_spec, # model specification object
                      preprocessor = weather_recipe, # recipe object
                      resamples = resampling_foldcv, # v-fold cross-validation object
                      grid = xgb_grid, # grid search object
                      control = control_race(save_pred = TRUE))

stopImplicitCluster() # stops parallel processing

beepr::beep()

xgb_res$.metrics[[2]]

```

## 4. Select Best Models

We select the best models using three strategies (best, within 1 SE, within 2% loss) which we learned in class:

```{r}

# Based on lowest RMSE

best_rmse <- xgb_res %>% 
  select_best(metric = "rmse")%>% 
  mutate(source = "best_rmse")

best_rmse

```


```{r}

# Based on lowest RMSE within 1% loss

best_rmse_pct_loss <- xgb_res %>% 
  select_by_pct_loss("min_n",
                     metric = "rmse",
                     limit = 1
                     )%>% 
  mutate(source = "best_rmse_pct_loss")

best_rmse_pct_loss

```

```{r}

# Based on lowest RMSE within 1 SE

best_rmse_one_std_err <- xgb_res %>% 
  select_by_one_std_err(metric = "rmse",
                        eval_time = 100,
                        trees
                        )%>% 
  mutate(source = "best_rmse_one_std_err")

best_rmse_one_std_err

```

Here we use all three methods which we learn in this class for R2.

```{r}

# Based on greatest R2

best_r2 <- xgb_res %>% 
  select_best(metric = "rsq")%>% 
  mutate(source = "best_r2")

best_r2

```

```{r}
# Based on greatest R2 within 1% loss
best_r2_pct_loss <- xgb_res %>% 
  select_by_pct_loss("min_n",
                     metric = "rsq",
                     limit = 1
                     ) %>% 
  mutate(source = "best_r2_pct_loss")

best_r2_pct_loss
```

```{r}
# Based on greatest R2 within 1 se
best_r2_one_std_error <- xgb_res %>% 
  select_by_one_std_err(metric = "rsq",
                        eval_time = 100,
                        trees
                        ) %>%
  mutate(source = "best_r2_one_std_error")

best_r2_one_std_error
```

## Compare and Finalize Model

```{r comparing values}
best_rmse %>% 
  bind_rows(best_rmse_pct_loss, 
            best_rmse_one_std_err, 
            best_r2, 
            best_r2_pct_loss, 
            best_r2_one_std_error)
```

## 5. Final Specification

```{r final_spec_fit}
final_spec <- boost_tree(
  trees = best_r2$trees,           # Number of boosting rounds (trees)
  tree_depth = best_r2$tree_depth, # Maximum depth of each tree
  min_n = best_r2$min_n,           # Minimum number of samples to split a node
  learn_rate = best_r2$learn_rate  # Learning rate (step size shrinkage)
) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("regression")

final_spec
```

## 6. Final Fit and Predictions

final_fit %>%
  collect_predictions()

```

## 7. Evaluate on *Test Set*

  collect_metrics()

```

-best_r2_one_std_error = 0.1936.

-best_rmse_pct_loss = 0.1855.

-best_rmse_one_std_err = 0.1254.

## 8. Evaluate on Training Set

```{r}
final_spec %>%
  fit(strength_gtex ~ .,
      data = bake(weather_prep, 
                  weather_train)) %>%
  augment(new_data = bake(weather_prep, 
                          weather_train)) %>% 
  rmse(strength_gtex, .pred) %>%
  bind_rows(
    
    
# R2
final_spec %>%
  fit(strength_gtex ~ .,
      data = bake(weather_prep, 
                  weather_train)) %>%
  augment(new_data = bake(weather_prep, 
                          weather_train)) %>% 
  rsq(strength_gtex, .pred))
```

## 9. Predicted vs Observed Plot

```{r}

final_fit %>%

```

## 10. Variable Importance

```{r final_spec}
final_spec %>%
  fit(strength_gtex ~ .,
         data = bake(weather_prep, weather_train)) %>% #There little change in variable improtance if you use full dataset
    vi() %>%
  mutate(
    Variable = fct_reorder(Variable, 
                           Importance)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Importance, 
             y = Variable)) +
  geom_col() +
